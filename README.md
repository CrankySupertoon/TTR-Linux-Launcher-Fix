# How To Use

1) Download the TTR.sh file from this git repository.
2) Place the TTR.sh file inside of your Toontown Rewritten Linux download.
3) Edit the .sh file with a Text Editor
4) On the third line change **cd ttr directory** to something like **cd /home/admin/Games/toontown-rewritten**
5) Run the .sh file via a Terminal Window

# Why this works
